cp -r agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r templates/* ~/.claude/templates/
```

## üí° Tips & Tricks

Effective toolbox usage patterns emerge through experience, though certain principles accelerate mastery. Understanding when agents activate automatically versus requiring explicit invocation prevents unnecessary specification. Similarly, recognizing repetitive patterns that benefit from command automation transforms workflows from reactive to proactive.

1. **Let Agents Auto-Engage**: Don't specify agents manually since they activate when needed.
2. **Use Commands for Repetition**: If you do something twice, there's probably a command for it.
3. **Combine Tools**: Chain commands and agents for powerful workflows.
4. **Trust the Expertise**: Agents use proven methodologies worth following their guidance.
5. **Customize for Your Needs**: Create agents for your specific domain or tech stack.
