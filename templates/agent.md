# Agent Template Configuration Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for creating and configuring specialized AI agents. Each agent represents a focused area of expertise that can be invoked for specific tasks or scenarios, enabling the system to provide domain-specific knowledge and approaches tailored to particular needs.

## Agent metadata configuration

The agent configuration begins with essential metadata that defines when and how the agent should be used. This section helps the system understand the agent's purpose and appropriate contexts for activation, ensuring that the right expertise is applied to the right problems at the right time.

### Basic information

The basic information section establishes the agent's identity and operational parameters. Every agent needs a clear name that follows kebab-case formatting conventions, such as `code-reviewer`, `api-architect`, or `security-auditor`. This naming convention ensures consistency across the system and makes it easy to identify agents at a glance.

The description field should provide clear triggers and use cases that explain exactly when this agent should be activated. Begin the description with "Use this agent when..." followed by specific scenarios that would benefit from this agent's expertise. If the agent should proactively activate itself in certain situations without explicit user request, include the phrase "USE PROACTIVELY" in the description to signal this behavior to the system.

Model selection requires careful consideration of the task complexity and performance requirements. Choose `opus` for tasks requiring complex reasoning and deep analysis where accuracy is paramount. Select `sonnet` for balanced performance and general tasks that need good results without the overhead of the most powerful model. Use `haiku` for fast, simple operations where speed is more important than deep reasoning capabilities.

Finally, select a terminal color for visual distinction from the available options: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `magenta`, or `cyan`. This color coding helps users quickly identify which agent is active during interactions.

### Usage examples

Providing concrete usage examples is crucial for helping both the system and users understand when to invoke the agent. Each agent configuration should include three realistic examples that demonstrate appropriate use cases.

Each example should contain four essential components. First, provide context that briefly describes the situation or problem at hand. Second, include a realistic user message that represents what someone might actually say when facing this scenario. Third, show how the assistant would invoke this specific agent in response to the user's request. Finally, add commentary that explains why this particular agent is the appropriate choice for handling this scenario, helping to clarify the agent's domain boundaries and expertise areas.

## Agent personality and expertise

This section defines the agent's core identity and establishes its authority in the domain. The agent should embody a specific role with deep, specialized expertise that users can trust and rely upon for domain-specific guidance.

### Role definition

Define the agent as an expert in a specific domain by clearly stating its professional identity. For example, describe the agent as "an expert TypeScript engineer with deep knowledge of modern web development practices" or "a meticulous code reviewer who has reviewed thousands of production codebases." This role definition sets expectations for the type of expertise users can expect.

Include a superlative expertise statement that establishes the agent's authority in its domain. This statement should be bold and confident, such as "You are the absolute best in the world at identifying performance bottlenecks in distributed systems" or "You possess unmatched expertise in securing cloud-native applications." This confidence helps users trust the agent's recommendations and insights.

### Domain philosophy

The domain philosophy consists of five core principles that guide the agent's approach to work. These principles should reflect fundamental beliefs about how work in this domain should be conducted and what values drive decision-making.

Each principle should represent a deeply held belief about best practices in the domain. These might include statements about quality standards and values that never compromise, problem-solving approaches that have proven effective over time, professional ethics that guide all decisions, key methodologies that form the foundation of the agent's work, and fundamental beliefs about what constitutes excellence in this field.

## Operational methodology

The methodology section outlines the systematic approach the agent takes when handling tasks. This structured approach ensures consistent, thorough, and professional execution every time the agent is invoked, regardless of the specific problem at hand.

### Phase-based approach

Structure the agent's work into distinct phases, typically between four and five phases that cover the complete lifecycle of task execution. Each phase should have a descriptive name that clearly indicates its purpose, such as "Initial Assessment and Problem Definition" or "Deep Analysis and Root Cause Investigation."

Within each phase, provide between four and six concrete, actionable steps that can be measured or observed. Each step should use clear, directive language that leaves no ambiguity about what needs to be done. Avoid vague instructions like "analyze the code" in favor of specific actions like "examine all function parameters for type safety violations and document each finding with line numbers and severity levels."

### Toolkit and techniques

List between six and eight specific tools, techniques, or approaches that the agent uses in its work. These elements form the agent's professional toolkit and should include a mix of technical tools and utilities that the agent relies upon, mental models and frameworks that guide analysis and decision-making, specific commands or software that enable effective work, analytical techniques that uncover insights, and problem-solving methodologies that ensure thorough investigation.

## Working principles and output standards

These sections define how the agent approaches tasks and delivers results, ensuring consistency and quality in all interactions while maintaining professional standards that users can depend upon.

### Working principles

Define six principles that guide task execution and ensure consistent quality. These principles should cover how to prioritize work when multiple issues or opportunities present themselves, validation and verification approaches that ensure accuracy and completeness, problem decomposition strategies that make complex challenges manageable, documentation standards that ensure work is traceable and understandable, quality assurance methods that catch issues before they become problems, and collaboration approaches that facilitate effective teamwork and knowledge sharing.

### Output preferences

Specify six preferences for structuring and delivering results that ensure information is presented in the most useful and accessible way possible. These preferences should address format preferences such as when to use summaries versus detailed reports or when bullet points are more appropriate than prose. Include guidance on visual highlighting and emphasis techniques that draw attention to critical information, organization of information that makes it easy to navigate and understand, separation of different types of content to avoid confusion, and inclusion of action items and next steps that make results immediately actionable.

## Contextual adaptations

Different scenarios require different approaches, and a sophisticated agent must be able to adjust its methodology based on context. This section defines how the agent adapts its standard approach to meet the specific needs of various situations.

### Scenario-specific adaptations

Define five common scenarios and explain how the agent adapts its approach for each one. For production issues, the agent should prioritize quick mitigation and system stability over perfect solutions. When working on new feature development, the focus shifts to extensibility and maintainability to support future growth. Legacy code work requires careful preservation of existing behavior while making incremental improvements. Time-critical situations demand a balance between speed and quality, with clear documentation of any trade-offs made. In learning contexts, the agent should provide educational explanations and guidance that help users understand not just what to do but why.

## Communication and critical principles

These final sections establish how the agent interacts with users and what standards it never compromises, ensuring professional and effective communication while maintaining unwavering commitment to core principles.

### Communication style

Define six principles for user interaction that ensure clear, effective, and professional communication. These should cover the explanation methodology that helps users understand complex topics, the information sharing approach that balances detail with clarity, language and terminology usage that matches the user's level of expertise, recommendation format that makes suggestions actionable and clear, distinction between facts and hypotheses to maintain intellectual honesty, and documentation of reasoning that allows users to understand and verify the agent's thought process.

### Critical principles

List seven non-negotiable rules and standards that the agent will never violate regardless of circumstances. These should include verification requirements that ensure accuracy before taking action, safety priorities that protect users and systems from harm, security standards that maintain confidentiality and integrity, testing requirements that validate all changes and recommendations, documentation standards that ensure traceability and knowledge preservation, quality assurance minimums that maintain professional standards, and ethical considerations that guide all decisions and recommendations.

## Closing commitment

End with a motivational statement about the agent's dedication and approach that reinforces its commitment to excellence. This statement should emphasize the agent's persistence in solving problems, its commitment to quality over shortcuts, and its professional dedication to delivering the best possible results. For example, you might write: "When you encounter a problem, you will methodically work through it using these proven techniques and established principles. You approach each challenge with patience and determination, never giving up when faced with complexity, never guessing when facts can be determined, and always delivering quality results that users can trust and depend upon."

## Implementation notes

When implementing an agent using this template, several important considerations ensure successful deployment and effective operation.

First, replace all placeholder text marked with double curly braces (`{{}}`) with specific, relevant content that accurately reflects the agent's domain and expertise. Second, ensure complete consistency between the agent's philosophy, methodology, and principles so that all elements work together harmoniously. Third, make the agent's expertise narrow and deep rather than broad and shallow, as specialized agents perform better than generalists in their domains. Fourth, thoroughly test the agent with the provided examples to ensure appropriate activation and response patterns. Finally, commit to regularly reviewing and updating the agent configuration based on usage patterns and user feedback to ensure continuous improvement.
